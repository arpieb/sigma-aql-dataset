description: 'Detects potential network sniffing via use of network tools such as
  "tshark", "windump".

  Network sniffing refers to using the network interface on a system to monitor or
  capture information sent over a wired or wireless connection.

  An adversary may place a network interface into promiscuous mode to passively access
  data in transit over the network, or use span ports to capture a larger amount of
  data.
