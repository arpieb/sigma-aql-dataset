description: 'Detects DLL sideloading of DLLs that are loaded by the SCM for some
  services (IKE, IKEEXT, SessionEnv) which do not exists on a typical modern system

  IKEEXT and SessionEnv service, as they call LoadLibrary on files that do not exist
  within C:\Windows\System32\ by default.

  An attacker can place their malicious logic within the PROCESS_ATTACH block of their
  library and restart the aforementioned services "svchost.exe -k netsvcs" to gain
  code execution on a remote machine.
