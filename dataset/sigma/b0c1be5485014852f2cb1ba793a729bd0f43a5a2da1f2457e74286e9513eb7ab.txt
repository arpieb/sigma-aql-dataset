description: Detects the execution of certutil with the "encode" flag to encode a
  file to base64. This can be abused by threat actors and attackers for data exfiltration
detection:
  condition: all of selection_*
  selection_cli:
    CommandLine|contains:
    - -encode
    - /encode
  selection_img:
    Image|endswith: \certutil.exe
    OriginalFileName: CertUtil.exe
falsepositives:
- As this is a general purpose rule, legitimate usage of the encode functionality
  will trigger some false positives. Apply additional filters accordingly
