description: 'Detects a suspicious copy operation that tries to copy a program from
  system (System32, SysWOW64, WinSxS) directories to another on disk.

  Often used to move LOLBINs such as ''certutil'' or ''desktopimgdownldr'' to a different
  location with a different name in order to bypass detections based on locations.

  '
detection:
  condition: 1 of selection_* and target
  selection_cmd:
    CommandLine|contains: 'copy '
    Image|endswith: \cmd.exe
  selection_other:
    Image|endswith:
    - \robocopy.exe
    - \xcopy.exe
    OriginalFileName:
    - robocopy.exe
    - XCOPY.EXE
  selection_pwsh:
    CommandLine|contains:
    - copy-item
    - ' copy '
    - 'cpi '
    - ' cp '
    Image|endswith:
    - \powershell.exe
    - \pwsh.exe
  target:
    CommandLine|contains:
    - \System32
    - \SysWOW64
    - \WinSxS
falsepositives:
- Depend on scripts and administrative tools used in the monitored environment (For
  example an admin scripts like https://www.itexperience.net/sccm-batch-files-and-32-bits-processes-on-64-bits-os/)
- When cmd.exe and xcopy.exe are called directly
- When the command contains the keywords but not in the correct order
