description: Detects when a built-in utility is used to decode and decrypt a payload
  after a macOS disk image (DMG) is executed. Malware authors may attempt to evade
  detection and trick users into executing malicious code by encoding and encrypting
  their payload and placing it in a disk image file. This behavior is consistent with
  adware or malware families such as Bundlore and Shlayer.
